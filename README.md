Problem Statement
A leading biomedical research institute, NovaGen Research Labs, is conducting large-scale population health studies to better understand how underlying health conditions influence disease risk and long-term health outcomes. Every year, the institute recruits thousands of volunteers who undergo medical examinations, lifestyle assessments, and clinical tests. However, the researchers currently lack a reliable way to consistently distinguish between individuals with generally healthy profiles and those who may be at higher health risk, limiting the effectiveness of participant selection and stratified analysis in their studies.

To address this challenge, the institute has compiled a dataset consisting of health records from 9,800 individuals collected over multiple observational studies. Each record represents a unique participant to avoid sampling bias and ensure independent observations. The dataset includes a combination of numerical and categorical health indicators, such as physiological measurements, lifestyle factors, and medical history attributes, providing a comprehensive view of each individual’s health status.

You are engaged as a Data Scientist to develop a predictive model that classifies individuals as “healthy” or “unhealthy” based on the available health data. This classification will support key research decisions, including:

• Selecting eligible participants for clinical trials and longitudinal studies
• Stratifying populations for risk-based analysis and outcome comparison
